    title: 'UBC Health and Wellness Online Quiz',
    techStack: ['React', 'Tailwind', 'MongoDB'],
    shortDescription:
      'An online Quiz educating students on sexual health created for UBC Health and Wellness Center @ https://health-quiz-853r-git-main-ashoolak.vercel.app/',
    longDescription:
      'Built a Next.js 13 website, integrating Tailwind CSS, and Hotjar for enhanced UX and user engagement analysis.;Conducted A/B testing on page aesthetics and navigational flow, optimizing background color and question transitions, which improved user engagement time by 30%.;Boosted monthly user count from 80 to 1000 and increased average site engagement from 1:19 to 5:38 minutes.;Added different types of cookie consent banners to analyze the behaviour of the users bsaed on the type of research received, contributing to an ongoing research at UBC',
    motivation:
      'While working closely with UBC Health and Wellness in a web development role, I learned about the challenges they faced in raising sexual health awareness through a PDF. Seeing an opportunity to blend my skills with a meaningful cause, I proposed transforming the PDF into an interactive quiz, making it both educational and enjoyable for students.',

    title: 'LinkedIn Networking Database',
    techStack: ['Oracle', 'PHP'],
    shortDescription:
      'A group project for CPSC 304, this initiative showcased our ability to efficiently create and query databases. We developed a robust system, demonstrating practical skills in database design and SQL querying.',
    longDescription:
      'Designed and normalized an Oracle-PHP database, producing a BCNF-compliant ER diagram with optimized data structures.;Developed 10+ efficient SQL queries for managing ISA hierarchies, weak entities, and aggregations.;Built a web application, integrating Oracle with PHP to handle user profiles, posts, and 1000s of social connections.',
    motivation:
      "The idea for this project hit me while I was scrolling through LinkedIn one day. I thought, 'Hey, why not create something like this for our CPSC 304 class at UBC?' I've always found LinkedIn super useful, and it seemed like a great way for us students to connect and share opportunities. So, I pitched this idea to my group, and we were all on board to work on this as our class project for CPSC 304",

    shortDescription:
      'Designed an autonomous, hydroelectric-powered robot for ship cleaning, reducing fuel consumption by 40% and winning Best Product Design at InnoVent Competition.',
    longDescription:
      'Engineered an autonomous robot for ship hull cleaning, resulting in a potential 40% fuel savings.;Implemented BFS algorithm for efficient pathfinding and programmed sensors to detect ship edges and organisms with temperatures over 18Â°C.;Secured Best Product Design award and achieved second place in the Sustainability division.',
    motivation:
      'Biofouling is a prevanlent issue within our current society where organisms get attached to the hulls of ships and create drag, significantly increase fuel consumption rates and costs as well as annual CO2 emissions and rapid biodiversity reduction. Being in the sustainability devision of the Innovent competition we decided to tackle this issue!',

      'Developed a full-stack banking simulation in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance for different types of bank card objects.;Implemented JSON for local data storage and crafted an interactive GUI with Swing for user interactions.;Achieved 100% code coverage, resulting in a streamlined debugging process, and cutting debugging time by 50%.',
    motivation:
      'My passion for business, particularly the intricacies of financial transactions and the algorithms behind them, inspired me to develop this project for my CPSC 210 capstone. I was intrigued by the mathematical aspects and the flow of money in banking systems. This simulation was an opportunity to delve into these interests, applying Object-Oriented Programming to create a realistic banking environment and tackle the challenges of efficient data handling and user interaction.',
